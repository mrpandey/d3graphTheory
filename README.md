> In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs, or lines.
> -- <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

D3 Graph Theory is a front-end project aimed at anyone who wants to learn graph theory. It provides a quick and interactive introduction to the subject. The visuals used in the project makes it an effective learning tool.

## Topics Covered So Far

The whole content is broken in several units. So far these units have been added.

The project is still expanding. New topics are added from time to time.

## Upcoming Topics

These topics are planned to be added.

- [ ] Planar Graphs
- [x] Chromatic Number
- [x] Trees
- [x] Rooted Trees
- [x] Spanning Tree
- [ ] Prim's Algorithm
- [ ] Kruskal's Algorithm

So, keep checking for updates. :smile:
