## How To Contribute

First of all, go through [WORKING.md](https://github.com/mrpandey/d3graphTheory/blob/master/WORKING.md) to know how D3 Graph Theory works (it's pretty simple actually). Now, here are some ways in which you can contribute to this project.

**Note:** Whenever creating a new issue, please make sure that the issue doesn't already exists in the issues list. If the issue is already present, you can add a comment there instead of opening a new one.

### 1. Report Bugs

If you spot a bug while playing around with the tutorials, please submit a bug report by creating a new issue. Don't forget to add a clear description of the bug.

### 2. Suggest Enhancements

You can suggest a new feature or improvements for an existing one. You can do this by opening a new issue.

### 3. Submit Changes

You can fork/clone this repository, commit some changes and then submit them as a pull request. These changes could be to resolve an issue or could be some of your own changes.

Before you make plan to make some major changes, it is recommended that you open an issue first or have a discussion on [gitter](https://gitter.im/d3graphTheory/community).

### 4. Documentation

If you spot errors in markdown files or think that they can be better, you can directly submit a pull request.
